# OpenACC Tutorial - Lab 1 (GPUs for Science 2020/NERSC)

Welcome to the first lab of the OpenACC Tutorial. In this lab you     will learn to compile a simple, serial application with the PGI compiler     and parallelize that code for multicore CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs using OpenACC. The lab uses a Jupyter notebook, like this one, and the PGI Compiler. If you are not familiar with Jupyter, you may execute the commands in a cell by pressing ctrl-enter or pressing the "Run" button at the top of the page. This lab is available in C or Fortran, please choose the version that best fits your needs below.
